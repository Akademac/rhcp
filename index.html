						Anthony Kiedis (/ˈkiːdɪs/ KEE-dis; born November 1, 1962) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, rapper and actor. He is the lead singer of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers, which he has fronted since its conception in 1983. Kiedis and his fellow band members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. Kiedis spent his youth in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with his mother before moving, shortly before his twelfth birthday, to Hollywood to live with his father. While attending Fairfax High School, Kiedis developed close friendships with fellow students Flea and Hillel Slovak, who at the time were members of a band called Anthym. After high school, Kiedis began taking classes at UCLA, but dropped out during the beginning of his sophomore year.

						He later received an offer to be the opening act for a local band, and enlisted Flea, Slovak, and drummer Jack Irons to assist. After a show under the name "Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem", the band progressed and the line-up eventually became the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He has recorded eleven studio albums with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Kiedis' lyrical style has evolved throughout his career; early recordings discussed topics such as sex and life in Los Angeles, while more recent songs focus on more reflective themes including love, addiction, and loss. Additionally, his vocal style has shifted from rapping to a more melodic technique. He struggled with drug addiction for the majority of his life up until the year 2000, since then he has remained drug free.

					Michael Peter Balzary (born 16 October 1962) known professionally as Flea, is an Australian musician, singer and actor. He is best known as the bassist and founding member of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers.

					Flea briefly appeared as the bassist for such bands as What Is This?, Fear, and Jane's Addiction. He has performed with rock 	supergroups Atoms for Peace, Antemasque, Pigface, and Rocket Juice & the Moon, and collaborated with Mars Volta, Johnny Cash, Tom Waits, Alanis Morissette, and Young MC. Flea also performed live with Nirvana in 1993 playing the trumpet.

					Flea incorporates elements of funk (including slap bass), psychedelic, punk, and hard rock. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers ranked Flea the second best bassist of all time, behind only John Entwistle.[1] In 2012, he and the other members of Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[2]

					Since 1984, Flea has acted in over 20 films and television series such as Suburbia, Back to the Future Part II and Part III, My Own Private Idaho, The Chase, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Dudes, Son in Law, The Big Lebowski, Low Down, Baby Driver and Boy Erased, in addition to voicing the character Donnie Thornberry in The Wild Thornberrys animated television series and films.

					Flea is also the co-founder of Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a non-profit music education organization founded in 2001 for underprivileged children. In 2019 Flea will release his book Acid for the Children: A Memoir which will detail his life prior to the formation of Red Hot Chili Peppers.

						Chadwick Gaylord Smith[1] (born October 25, 1961)[2][3] is an American musician who is the current drummer of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers, which he joined in 1988. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. Smith is also the drummer of the hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot, formed in 2008, and is currently the drummer of the all-instrumental outfit Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats, who formed in 2007. As one of the most highly sought-after drummers, Smith has recorded with Glenn Hughes, Johnny Cash, John Fogerty, The Dixie Chicks, Jennifer Nettles, Kid Rock, Jake Bugg, The Avett Brothers, and Joe Satriani. In 2010, joined by Dick Van Dyke and Leslie Bixler, he released Rhythm Train, a critically acclaimed children's album which featured Smith singing and playing various instruments.

						Widely regarded as one of rock music's best drummers, Spin Magazine placed Smith at #10 on their list of the "100 Greatest Drummers of Alternative Music" in May 2013.[4] Readers of UK-based Rhythm magazine ranked Smith and Red Hot Chili Pepper bassist Flea the fourth-greatest rhythm section of all time in their June 2013 issue.[5] The drummer is also known for his charity work especially with young musicians. He has been a lobbyist in support of music education in U.S. public schools. Smith is also widely known for the strong resemblance between himself and comedian Will Ferrell, which has led to various comparisons over the years and eventually led to a joking public feud and drum battle for charity on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in May 2014, which led straight into the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing a cover of Blue Öyster Cult's "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" in the show as a reference to the Saturday Night Live "More Cowbell" skit (in which Ferrell played fictional cowbell player Gene Frenkle).[6][7] Smith is also the host of the PBS concert series, Landmarks Live in Concert, which began in January 2017.
